In Java, classes and objects are fundamental 
concepts of object-oriented programming(OOP).

1. Class:
A class is a blueprint or a template that 
defines the structure and behavior (data 
and methods) that objects of that class 
will have. It can include variables (also 
called attributes or fields) and methods 
(functions that define actions).

2. Object:
An object is an instance of a class. When 
a class is defined, no memory is allocated
until an object of that class is created.
Each object has its own values for the 
variables defined in the class and can 
use the methods of that class.
